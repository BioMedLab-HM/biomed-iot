# Tests After Installation
Some of the commands in this document need deeper understanding of the matter.
More explanations may come in the future.

[(Back to the README file)](../README.md)  

### Reboot if not yet done

	sudo reboot

### Check config.toml and get DJANGO_ADMIN_PASS for website login

	nano /etc/biomed-iot/config.toml

### Website

Check all functions (at least check if each page and service like Node-RED and Grafana opens)  
Check the database by using an MQTT-in node in Node-RED and send {"test":1} to the topic for devicestatus.  
you have to create a 'Device' on the 'Devices' >'Device List' first.  
Finallly delete the data.

### Website Admin Dashboard

Go to the '/admin' path of the website
for credentials, (see DJANGO_ADMIN_PASS in /etc/biomed-iot/config.toml)
Check for completeness of data for:
- Profile (Email)
- Node red user datas (will be created only after first start of Node-RED)
- Mqtt meta datas (User Topic ID, Nodered Role Name, Device Role Name)
- Mqtt clients (Username, Password, Textname, Rolename)
- Influx user datas (Bucket Name, Bucket ID, Bucket Token)

### Setup Logs

	cd /home/<user>/biomed-iot/setup_files/setup_logs  # substitute <user> with your linux username
	ls -al
	grep -R "Error" .  # search for "Error" or other keywords in log files
	# Read all setup logs
	nano main.log
	nano install_xx_<name>.log  # substitute 'xx_<name>' according to the respective log file name

### Nginx

	sudo nginx -t
	sudo systemctl status nginx.service

### Gunicorn

	sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket
	sudo systemctl status gunicorn.service
	journalctl -u gunicorn.service -n -f  # auch w√§hrend Webseitentest

### Docker/Node-RED

	docker ps -a  # list all containers (should be zero directly after installation)

Test Docker network with ping command
Create two test containers with different names (test 01 and test02), each one with this command structure:
	docker run -d \
	--name test01 \
	--network bridge \
	-p 1880 \
	custom-node-red

	ping 172.17.0.2  # ping test01 container should work
Enter container test01
	docker exec -it test01 /bin/bash
	ping 172.17.0.1  # ping host system should work
	ping 172.17.0.3  # ping test02 container should not work


### Mosquitto und Mosquitto dynamic-security.json

	sudo systemctl status mosquitto.service
	sudo nano /var/lib/mosquitto/dynamic-security.json

### PostgreSQL (with <your_postgres_user> from config.toml)

	sudo systemctl status postgresql
	sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres  # login to postgres CLI as postgres admin
	\du  # list all users with their roles
	\l  # list all databases
	\dt  # List database tables
	exit  # to exit psql CLI


Have all variables been inserted correctly?
